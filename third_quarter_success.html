  <h1>Third Quarter Success</h1>
  <p>Theory: Teams that overperform expectations in the third quarter demonstrate that they are well coached and can take 
    control of a game in the second half. These teams will do well in the playoffs and have a better chance of winning a title.</p>

  <p>Story: Growing up as a Warriors fan, things took off when Steve Kerr became the head coach in 2015. After going to the 
    locker room for halftime, the Warriors team would come out and win the 3rd quarter by a large margin, taking control of 
    a game and demoralizing the other team. Whether it was to comeback from 10+ down, or to turn a tied game into a 10+ point
    lead, the Warriors in their dynastic era showed that 3rd quarter success could be a key to finals hopes.</p>

  <p>This led me to the following analysis. In Figure 1, a plot of shows 3rd quarter success versus halftime margins. 
    The x-axis is the point differential for each team at halftime, and the y-axis is the point differential in the 3rd quarter 
    for that game.</p>
    
  <p>A line of best fit shows that a larger halftime margin (i.e. a lead) is intuitively assoiated with a larger 3rd quarter success. 
    But, for each point, we can determine a residual from the line of best fit, representing the amount by which that team overperformed 
    expectations.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the sum of all the residuals for each team. We can see that the top teams are generally the best teams in the 
    league, but more interestingly, we can see which teams are better in the 3rd quarter than their record might suggest. I hypothesize 
    that these teams will be dark horses in the playoffs and could spoil a favorite's title hopes.</p>
