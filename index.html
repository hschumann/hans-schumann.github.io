  <p>My name is Hans Schumann. I am a Data Scientist with a fascination for using data to make discoveries and
    better understand the world. In high school, I read Moneyball and my love for statistics and data science only
    grew from there.</p>

  <p>I pursued a degree in Statistics and Data Science from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, and have since worked at
    Unanimous AI and KaChan Research. Some of this work has led me to use do analysis on Sports Data.</p>

  <p>This page will contain research that I find interesting and want to share with anyone else who is curious.
    I hope you enjoy reading!</p>
